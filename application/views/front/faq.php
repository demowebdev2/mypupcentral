            <h4><b>Guidelines for Puppy Listings</b></h4>
            <p>At My Pups Central in order to keep our marketplace running properly for our puppy buyers, we have a few guidelines to follow for posting listings.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h4><b>Classified Puppy Advertising</b></h4>
            <p>To get started, create a breeder/seller account. Once you provide required information and your account is approved, you can start advertising your puppies!</p>
            
            <p>To create an ad, fill out information about the puppy, like his or her name, his breed, age, and personality. Then include your contact information, like your phone number and an email. Then add a picture or pictures of the puppy and a video of the puppy you're selling. Pictures of the puppy from different angles, and doing different activities are recommended. We encourage you to also include pictures of the puppy's parents. Do not include pictures of other puppies for sale or your ad will be removed immediately. If you would like to sell more than one puppy, you must create more ads.</p>
            
            <p>After creating your ad, you can check out with a credit card (Visa/Mastercard/Discover) on our secure server.</p>
          
            
            <p>Customers will contact you directly through the contact information you provided. Your listing will automatically update by breed up to 3 times per day. You cannot change the puppy or breed once the listing has been created. The ad will automatically go offline after 45 days unless you renew. We reserve the right to edit or delete any individual ad for impropriety or misuse of our listing guidelines at My Pups Central.</p>
            
            <p>My Pups Central will not request to confirm your account once it is created, nor ask for your login information for any reason. If you receive a notice or an email that your account must be confirmed, let us know. These may be phishing attempts, and they are not emails coming from My Pups Central.</p>
            
             <br>
            
          
          
            
            <h4><b>One Puppy Per Ad</b></h4>
            <p>Each ad is only for a single puppy, not a litter. If you have multiple puppies in a litter for sale, you must create an ad for each puppy in the litter.</p>

    Do you want your puppy to be respectful when guests visit your home or when you take them out in public but 
don’t have the time and experience it takes to help them become that respectful, well-mannered dog? This is 
what our professional trainers excel at. For the period of time your puppy is in training, your puppy lives in the 
trainer’s home where they learn to be respectful around children and adults. They learn commands, potty 
training, leash training, and crate training. The home setting allows a hands-on approach with the idea of 
mimicking the environment of your home to make a smooth transition after graduation. See the following 
training packages and choose the package that best fits you.

            <h4>3 week program </h4>
            <h3 class="incsspricecolor">$1500</h3>
            <p>
            With the Puppy Basics program your puppy is expected to learn basic commands and puppy 
skills as well as respectful behavior. A puppy cannot be expected to have entirely mastered 
everything that is introduced to them within these 3 weeks but they will go home with a 
solid foundation for you to continue building upon. Weekly video updates will be shared 
with you. This will help you to learn the methods used by the trainer and continue in the 
same fashion, so your puppy does not get confused. 
            </p>
            <h4 class="mt-3">
    What will my puppy learn?<br>
    Commands
</h4>
<p>Sit</p>
<p>
    Lay Down </p>
<p>
    Come (often followed by their name) </p>
<p>
    Yes (confirms correct response) </p>
<p>
    No (discourages incorrect response)</p>
    <p>Shake</p>
<h4 class="mt-5">
    Potty Training
</h4>
<p>
    We will begin the process of teaching your puppy to go potty outside instead of in the house
    on the floors or in their crate. You may make specific requests regarding bell training or pee pad training. (Please
    note- with the 3 week program we do expect your puppy to come home
    and still have a few accidents)

</p>
<h4 class="mt-5">
    Crate Training
</h4>
<p>
    Your puppy will begin learning to voluntarily go into their crate when asked and accept their 
    crate as their personal home and safe place, as well as the place where they sleep at night 
    and during nap time. 
    

</p>
<h4 class="mt-5">
    Leash Training
</h4>
<p>Your puppy will be introduced to walking on a leash. 

    

</p>
<h4 class="mt-5">
    Name Recognition 

</h4>
<p>
    The trainer will familiarize your puppy with the name you have chosen for them.
</p>
<h4 class="mt-5">
    Routine Establishment
</h4>
<p>
    The trainer will establish a daily meal time, bed time, nap time routine, as well as training 
sessions and play times. Establishing a routine is important for a puppy to reach their full 
potential. 
</p>
<h4 class="mt-5">
    Behavior
</h4>
<p>
    Any bad behavior like nipping or jumping on guests for attention will be discouraged.

                    With the Advanced Puppy program your puppy is expected to learn additional commands

                    you to continue to work with and expand their potential. Weekly video updates will be

                <p class="color-black">A puppy’s potential varies between breeds and individual personalities. Some breeds learn quicker than others. Additionally, each 
                    puppy is different. Some puppies are more laid back and not as motivated to learn certain commands and leash training but will do 
                    better with potty training, crate training and learning respectful behavior. Other puppies may have a very high energy level and will 
                    learn commands quickly but will take more time to learn potty training and respectful behavior. Although our trainers devote their 
                    time and knowledge to helping your puppy reach their full potential, individual results will vary. Be sure to ask your breeder about 
                    your puppy’s personality before placing a deposit</p>

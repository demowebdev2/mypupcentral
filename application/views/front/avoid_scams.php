            <p>Ask for proof of any vet checks, vaccinations (where applicable), microchipping, and/or pedigree papers. Be aware that the puppy should be at least eight weeks old at the point when it goes home with you. A responsible breeder would never send you home with a puppy younger than that. </p>
            
            <p>Breeders will often ask for a deposit before they will add you to their list and often it's legitimate, but before you hand over your hard-earned money, make sure all details are very clear. Deposit, payments, or when balance is due.</p>

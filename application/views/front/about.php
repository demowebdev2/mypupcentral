            <p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to Puppy Verify! In 2020, some local families created Puppy Verify with the intent to connect healthy puppies with caring families. Puppy Verify does not condone Puppy Mills, and through technology, we are making it a thing of the past. We require breeders to use our digital process for vaccination schedules which means they can’t fudge information. They must upload the labels used for administering vaccines and de-wormers according to a rigorous vaccination schedule. This technology is provided by My Dogs ID (Mydogsid.com) where Microchip pre-registration from the breeder and lifetime registration from the new family is facilitated. This allows you as the puppy owner to buy with confidence and know you are getting a digital shot record that cannot be altered, ever.

Any breeders currently listed will be given time to transfer over to digital shot records. Our goal is to make this mandatory by March 1st, 2020.</p>

                <p>We strongly discourage all breeding practices that compromise the health and well-being of innocent dogs and puppies. Listed below are some of the steps we take to help you find a quality breeder through our website:</p>
                <p>The adoption of a puppy is a big commitment. As a prospective dog owner, we suggest that you thoroughly research the breeds you are interested in. By following these recommendations, you are ensuring that the puppy you choose is a good fit for your family.</p>

      <p>At Puppy Verify we don’t just collect any available background information on the breeder, we make the breeder provide verifiable data. If they don’t provide this legitimate information, they can’t list a dog with us. If it is proven that a breeder is using illegal or inhumane breeding practices, we then disqualify that breeder from ever advertising on our website.</p>

       <p> We educate Dog Breeders on breeding standards and the importance of selling only healthy puppies with good genetics. We will also require genetic guarantees if they aren’t currently offering them on their own to protect you as the puppy owner. We encourage people to consider adoption if they are experienced and have the means to care for an adopted or rescued dog. For more information on adopting a dog, you can visit a local Shelter or Rescue.</p>
